## 🎸 SQL Analytics SQL Play

This portfolio explores in-game data using SQL, based on the SQL Play apps database structure. It covers the best selling tracks, monthly revenue trend, best selling artist, and more. The game itself use sqlite languange for queries.

The [SQL Analytics SQL Play] folder contains data based on the [SQL Play Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sql_playground).

The app itself uses the modified table name of the [chinook-database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). On the database folder, I will provide the schema of the database that this app use.

You can download the game and use my code straight at the in-game terminal to check how each code performs.

The queries for each use case is saved as .sql format which you can open with any text editor app.

I will also upload the data schema of the database that the game use.

You can still find the SQL_Use_Case_sql_play.docx that contains the documentation purpose, sql queries, and the screenshot of the output table
