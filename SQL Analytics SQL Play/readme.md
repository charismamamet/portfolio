## 🎸 SQL Analytics SQL Play

The [SQL Analytics SQL Play] folder contains data based on the [SQL Play Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sql_playground).

The app itself uses the modified table name of the [chinook-database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). On the database folder, I will provide the schema of the database that this app use.

You can download the game and use my code straight at the in-game terminal to check how each code performs.

The queries for each use case is saved as .sql format which you can open with any text editor app.

I will also upload the data schema of the database that the game use.

You can still find the SQL_Use_Case_sql_play.docx that contains the documentation purpose, sql queries, and the screenshot of the output table
