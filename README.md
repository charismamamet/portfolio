# Portfolio
Hey, thanks for reading this readme. This portfolio folder contains both dummy project and actual project that i've done.

If you're interested to talk about these projects personally, please contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charismarahmat)


## üßô SQL Analytics rAthena

This portfolio explores in-game data using SQL, based on the rAthena database structure. It covers character ownership, item hoarding behavior, login activity, and more.

You can find the rAthena database schema on [rAthena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena).

The folders, such as [SQL Analytics rAthena], contains the queries, mock-data, and database.

The queries folder contains the .sql of each use cases.

The mock-data folder contains the mock data of the table that got used in the use-case.

Meanwhile, the database folder will contains the schema of the tables.

If you're wondering about the whole tables of rAthena database, please visit the rAthena github page.

You can also find the SQL_Use_Case.docx that contains the documentation of purpose, sql query, and the screenshot of output table.


## üé∏ SQL Analytics SQL Play

The [SQL Analytics SQL Play] folder contains data based on the [SQL Play Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sql_playground).

The app itself uses the modified table name of the [chinook-database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). On the database folder, I will provide the schema of the database that this app use.

You can download the game and use my code straight at the in-game terminal to check how each code performs.

The queries for each use case is saved as .sql format which you can open with any text editor app.

I will also upload the data schema of the database that the game use.

You can still find the SQL_Use_Case_sql_play.docx that contains the documentation purpose, sql queries, and the screenshot of the output table

## üçÉ SQL Braze Usecase

The [SQL Braze  Usecase] folder contains several sql script for CRM use-case with Braze as its tool. You can refer to [Braze's SQL Table schema](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/sql_segments/sql_segments_tables#table-of-contents) for more informaion about the table structures.

Please open the queries folder to find the script on several available use-cases, starting with creating the manual last-touch-non-direct (LTND) model for CRM campaign purchase attribution, or the user ID exclusion logic.

## üì© SQL CRM usecases

It is no uncommon for CRM officers to work closely with data team to do several analysis, such as same-basket-analysis for product recommendation logic, or segmenting users based on the purchasing power. All those use cases are available on the [SQL CRM usecases] folder.

Disclaimer: Although the code on this folder is created by myself, I consult ChatGPT to give me hints and directions when I stumble upon some roadblock or when I suffer with code-block.
